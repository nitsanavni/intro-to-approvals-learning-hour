# Test Structure

## Q - How do you usually structure tests?

How is a single test structured?
How are multiple tests for a single module?

> Rule - one person talks, another writes for them

Your answers here:

-   the way i write test.. i think what is the next action i need to do.. and validate it
-   go for the simplest next action
-   Divide the test-file (incase of service) to several "parts" (ex. describe)
-   test is to a check a default value and than call on a function and see if the function manipulated the data correctly
