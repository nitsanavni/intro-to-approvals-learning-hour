# Exercise - Use Asserts

## Goal

Let's build [fizzbuzz](https://sammancoaching.org/kata_descriptions/fizzbuzz.html) with micro-asserts.

## Steps

> Hint: use Split Editor to follow along

> Note: take your time, we don't have to complete all steps

-   [x] run the assert-based test, see it fail
        in the terminal:

        ```
        cd typescript
        ./menu.sh
        ```

-   [x] make the test pass, make only the smallest change necessary
        you can follow links with `ctrl + enter`
        [test is here](../typescript/fizzbuzz.spec.ts)
        [code is here](../typescript/fizzbuzz.ts)

-   [x] run the assert-based test continuously in the terminal

    -   [x] you can find the relevant script with `./menu.sh`
    -   [x] test should still pass

-   [x] `fizzbuzz(2)` (n)

    -   [x] add a new test / or new assert
    -   [x] see it fail
    -   [x] make it pass, with the smallest change possible
    -   [x] refactor if you like

-   [x] `fizzbuzz(3)` (Fizz)

    -   [x] add a new test / or new assert
    -   [x] see it fail
    -   [x] make it pass, with the smallest change possible
    -   [x] refactor if you like

-   [ ] `fizzbuzz(4)` (just another number)

    -   [ ] add a new test / or new assert
    -   [ ] **challenge / optional:** see it fail
    -   [ ] make it pass, with the smallest change possible
    -   [ ] refactor if you like

-   [ ] `fizzbuzz(5)` (Buzz)

    -   [ ] add a new test / or new assert
    -   [ ] see it fail
    -   [ ] make it pass, with the smallest change possible
    -   [ ] refactor if you like

-   [ ] `fizzbuzz(6)` (multiple of 3)

    -   [ ] add a new test / or new assert
    -   [ ] see it fail
    -   [ ] make it pass, with the smallest change possible
    -   [ ] refactor if you like

-   [ ] `fizzbuzz(10)` (multiple of 5)

    -   [ ] add a new test / or new assert
    -   [ ] see it fail
    -   [ ] make it pass, with the smallest change possible
    -   [ ] refactor if you like

-   [ ] `fizzbuzz(15)` (FizzBuzz)

    -   [ ] add a new test / or new assert
    -   [ ] see it fail
    -   [ ] make it pass, with the smallest change possible
    -   [ ] refactor if you like

-   [ ] add `Whizz` and `Bang`, using the same approach as earlier steps
