-   took a bit longer than one hour, but not a lot longer
-   they caught the contrast with the more classical TDD
-   connect was not clear enough - wanted to focus on **structure** rather than contents; but still it did the job of getting us in the mind-space of test design
-   gitpod
    -   strict strong style navigation for markdown too
    -   multiple people editing the same file - doesn't work, it's not google doc
    -   the diff tool did not open on their browsers
        -   could add a script for that
        -   don't delete the received file
        -   pin the diff tab
    -   pure presentation part - there's probably an extension for markdown to slides
        -   marp!
-   should try this with cyber dojo
-   follow-ups wanted
    -   approvals infra - hot to set it up?
    -   scrubbers
-   explain - they weren't familiar with this usage of `assert`
-   +1 keyboard shortcut to navigate between markdown files
-   +1 `menu.sh`
    -   maybe there's an extension for that...
-   explain
    -   +1 I think it was pretty clear
    -   -1 but not so interactive...
-   live demo went well
-   checklists
    -   worked well up to a point
    -   I think they liked it
-   we got farther with approvals
